## UI
- Do not rate own messages
- Scroll channel down to the bottom
- Notify user if server is down
- Hide account status if requested or small screen

- Reconnect logic
- Disconnect logic (remove event pushers)
- Last sync time logic needs quite a bit of work. It's naive right now, assuming that events always come in order.

## Tests
- Demurrage calc. tests need update
